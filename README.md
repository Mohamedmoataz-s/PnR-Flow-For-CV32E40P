# PnR-Flow-For-CV32E40P
This project demonstrates a full ASIC RTL-to-GDSII flow for the cv32e40p RISC-V core using Synopsys tools. It covers synthesis, floorplanning, power setup, placement, CTS, routing, timing closure, and final GDS export, implementing industry-grade physical design practices for a real CPU core.
